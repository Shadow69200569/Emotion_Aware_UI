# <h2>Emotion Aware UI</h2>

This project uses **face-api.js** to detect facial emotions in real time through your webcam.
Based on your expression (happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral), the interface changes its colors, text, and behavior.
Built using **React** and **Vite**.

## <h3>How to Run the Project</h3>

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Make sure the face-api model files are placed inside:

```
public/models/
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open the link shown in the terminal (usually):

```
http://localhost:5173
```

5. Allow camera access when the browser asks.
